<strong>Different Programming Languages</strong><br>
13 programming languages defining the future of coding.
<br>
<p>
    Faster, smarter programming, with fewer bugs. Those are the promises coming from the 
    creators of the latest round of languages to capture the attention of programmers. Yes, 
    they're the same buzzwords we've heard before, but the lack of novelty is no reason to dismiss them.
     The future of coding requires stability and good practices so our innovations will work. In
     fact, our projects are often so much bigger now, we need the innovation more than ever
