                Hello, and welcome to my portfolio . My name is <b>Rushelle Phillips.</b> <br>
                I am currently a student studying <b>Health Informatics </b> at <b>Centennial College</b> <br>
                I was born and raised in Jamaica. <br>
                I like enjoy the outdoor settings. I believe traveling gives you a new perspective to everything in life. 
                You will see and get to know all  cultures  which includes there dishes, what the stand for a nation/country, 
                but most of you will know twaht make then who they . 
                One of favourite technology to work with and play around would be <br>
                <b>cryto programming which is simple and old school i would say</b> 
                I also like to work with <b>database architecture design just as tool to expnad my knowlwdge.</b> <br>
